## Security and Compliance Controls (Your Shield and Sword) 🛡️⚔️

- **BAA First, Fun Follows:** Signed before any secrets spill!  
- **PHI-Free Zone:** Synthea synthetic data only — real stuff? Not on our watch!  
- **Fort Knox Encryption:** TLS in flight, SSE-S3/KMS/Azure SSE at rest. Impenetrable!  
- **Minimal Access Magic:** Scoped IAM roles, time-limited creds — least privilege FTW!  
- **Data Diet and Delete:** Keep only what's needed, zap it when done.  
- **Audit Trail Awesomeness:** Logs for every ingress, check, and peek. Transparency level: MAX! 📜

## Secure Transfer Recipes (Cook Up Some Ingress Magic) 🍳

Whip up secure transfers like a pro! All recipes use Synthea synthetic data for that zero-risk flavor. Choose your adventure:

1. **SFTP (Simple, Speedy, Secure!)** 🚀

```
# Upload (client-side) — Easy peasy!
sftp -i /path/to/key demo_ingress@ingress.qmtry.ai <<'EOF'
put ./synthea/*.csv /incoming/synthea/
bye
EOF
```

2. **AWS S3 (Your Bucket, Our Read-Only Peek!)** ☁️

```
# Example: create a bucket and upload (customer side)
aws s3 mb s3://qmtry-demo-synthea --region us-east-1
aws s3 sync ./synthea s3://qmtry-demo-synthea/synthea/
```

We'll swap IAM ARNs and tight policies during BAA time!

3. **Azure Blob Storage (Blob-tastic Uploads!)** 🟦

```
# Upload with az CLI — Smooth as butter!
az storage blob upload-batch \
  --account-name <yourAccount> \
  --destination 'qmtry-demo/synthea' \
  --source ./synthea
```

4. **BigQuery External Table (No-Copy Ninja Move!)** 📊

```
-- Customer creates an external table from GCS with synthetic CSVs
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE `demo.synthea_patients`
WITH CONNECTION `us.gcs.my_conn`
OPTIONS (
  format = 'CSV',
  uris = ['gs://qmtry-demo/synthea/patients/*.csv'],
  skip_leading_rows = 1
);
```

## FAQ (Quick Answers to Burning Questions) ❓🔥

- **Real PHI in Pilot?** Nah, demo starts Synthea-style. PHI post-BAA and security thumbs-up!  
- **Demo Timeline?** Boom — 2–4 business days after BAA and setup. Lightning fast! ⚡  
- **What Do We Keep?** Bare minimum. Delete demo data on your say-so! 🗑️
