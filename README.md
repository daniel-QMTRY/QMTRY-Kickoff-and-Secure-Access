Security and Compliance Controls (Your Shield and Sword) 🛡️⚔️
BAA First: Signed before any non-public data moves.

PHI-Free Demo: Synthea synthetic data only.

Encryption: TLS in transit; server-side encryption (SSE-S3/KMS/Azure SSE) at rest.

Least Privilege: Scoped IAM roles and time-boxed credentials.

Minimization and Retention: Keep only what is needed; delete on request.

Audit Trail: Logged ingress, validation, and access.

What to Bring to the Call (Pack Your Gear!) 🎒
Your Goal: Stars, HEDIS, UM/RCM, population health — define the win.

Cloud Preference: AWS / Azure / GCP.

Ingress Choice: SFTP, S3, Blob, or BigQuery.

Tech Contact: IAM/keys setup buddy.

Deadlines and Success Metrics: We’ll align and hit them.

Secure Transfer Recipes (Cook Up Some Ingress Magic) 🍳
All examples assume Synthea synthetic data (no PHI).

1) SFTP (Simple, Speedy, Secure)
bash
Copy
Edit
# Upload (client-side)
sftp -i /path/to/key demo_ingress@ingress.qmtry.ai <<'EOF'
put ./synthea/*.csv /incoming/synthea/
bye
EOF
2) AWS S3 (Your Bucket, Our Read-Only Peek)
bash
Copy
Edit
# Create bucket and upload (customer side)
aws s3 mb s3://qmtry-demo-synthea --region us-east-1
aws s3 sync ./synthea s3://qmtry-demo-synthea/synthea/
We exchange exact IAM ARNs and least-privilege bucket policies in the BAA/ingress worksheet.

3) Azure Blob Storage
bash
Copy
Edit
az storage blob upload-batch \
  --account-name <yourAccount> \
  --destination 'qmtry-demo/synthea' \
  --source ./synthea
4) BigQuery External Table (No-Copy Ninja Move)
sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE `demo.synthea_patients`
WITH CONNECTION `us.gcs.my_conn`
OPTIONS (
  format = 'CSV',
  uris = ['gs://qmtry-demo/synthea/patients/*.csv'],
  skip_leading_rows = 1
);
Evidence Bundle (Your Victory Loot) 🏆
Ingress checklist — who/what/when, key custody, TTL.

Validation report — schema, row counts, null %, type checks.

Run log — timestamped events.

Demo workbook — queries and visuals.

Security summary — controls and retention policy.

All exportable for auditors.

gender	STRING	✅	Coded per Synthea
encounter_date	DATE	✅	
code_system	STRING	✅	e.g., ICD-10, RxNorm (synthetic)
code	STRING	✅	
value	STRING	✅	Observation or metric

PHI Policy (Demo Mode): Synthea only. No direct or indirect identifiers.

FAQ (Quick Answers to Burning Questions) ❓🔥
Real PHI in Pilot? Initial demo is Synthea-only. PHI only after BAA and security sign-off.

Demo Timeline? Typically 2–4 business days after BAA and ingress setup.

What Do We Keep? Minimum necessary; delete on request.
